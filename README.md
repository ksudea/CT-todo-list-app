# CT-todo-list-app
CT mini project: To-do List Application

To-Do List App Features:
* Adding a task with a title (by default “Incomplete” and "low" priority).
* Viewing the list of tasks with their titles, statuses, and priorities.
* Marking a task as complete.
* Changing the priority of a task (3 possible priorities: low, medium, high)
* Deleting a task.
* Quitting the application.

# How to run app on CLI
## Linux / Git Bash
I recommend using git bash even if on Windows. 

Run the following:

$ ln -s to_do_list.sh todo

Next, type "./todo" in git bash/shell. The app should be running now!

## Windows

Run Windows Command Prompt as administrator.

Run the following:

$ mklink todo to_do_list.bat

Next, type ".\todo" in Command Prompt. The app should be running (I faced some glitches with
Windows, so I recommend bash)!
